    <div id="zebra" class="visible">
      Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: the
      Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus
      Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes
      come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of
      these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and
      southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands,
      and mountainous areas. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable
      harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while
      Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds.

    <div id="etymology" class="hidden">
      The English name "zebra" derives from Italian, Spanish or Portuguese. Its origins may lie in the Latin
      equiferus, meaning "wild horse". Equiferus appears to have entered into Portuguese as ezebro or zebro, which was
      originally used for a legendary equine in the wilds of the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages. In 1591,
      Italian explorer Filippo Pigafetta recorded "zebra" being used to refer to the African animals by Portuguese
      visitors to the continent.In ancient times, the African zebra was called hippotigris ("horse tiger") by the
      Greeks and Romans.
      The word "zebra" was traditionally pronounced with a long initial vowel, but over the course of the 20th century
      the pronunciation with the short initial vowel became the norm in the UK and the Commonwealth.The
      pronunciation with a long initial vowel remains standard in US English.

    <div id="captivity" class="hidden">
      Zebras have been kept in captivity since at least the Roman Empire. In later times, captive zebras have been shipped around the world, often for diplomatic reasons. In 1261, Sultan Baibars of Egypt established an embassy with Alfonso X of Castile and sent a zebra and other exotic animals as gifts. In 1417, a zebra was gifted to the Chinese people by Somalia and displayed before the Yongle Emperor. The fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir received a zebra from Ethiopia in 1620 and Ustad Mansur made a painting of it. In the 1670s, Ethiopian Emperor Yohannes I exported two zebras to the Dutch governor of Jakarta. These animals would eventually be given by the Dutch to the Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan.
      In 1882, Ethiopia sent a zebra to French president Jules Grévy, and the species it belonged to was named in his honour.

    <div id="characteristics" class="hidden">
      As with all wild equines, zebra have barrel-chested bodies with tufted tails, elongated faces and long necks with long, erect manes. Their thin legs are each supported by a spade-shaped toe covered in a hard hoof. Their dentition is adapted for grazing; they have large incisors that clip grass blades and rough molars and premolars well suited for grinding. Males have spade-shaped canines, which can be used as weapons in fighting. The eyes of zebras are at the sides and far up the head, which allows them to look over the tall grass while feeding. Their moderately long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.
      Unlike horses, zebras and asses have chestnut callosities present only on their front legs. In contrast to other living equines, zebra have longer front legs than back legs.

    <div id="taxonomy" class="hidden">
      Zebras are classified in the genus Equus (known as equines) along with horses and asses. These three groups are the only living members of the family Equidae. The plains zebra and mountain zebra were traditionally placed in the subgenus Hippotigris (C. H. Smith, 1841) in contrast to the Grévy's zebra which was considered the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus (Heller, 1912). Groves and Bell (2004) placed all three species in the subgenus Hippotigris. A 2013 phylogenetic study found that the plains zebra is more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras. The extinct quagga was originally classified as a distinct species.Later genetic studies have placed it as the same species as the plains zebra, either a subspecies or just the southernmost population. Molecular evidence supports zebras as a monophyletic lineage.
